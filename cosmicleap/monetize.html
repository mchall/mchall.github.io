		          <p class="major">Seriously, "<?=$name?>" is allowed to monetize videos using our games for commercial goals. It is good for us too when people share their opinion about our games, you know. Free marketing and all that, but also a good way for us to lift our moods when we're a bit demotivated - watching videos of people playing our games is really energizing for us. We would recommend it to engineers and designers over at your place.</p>

		            <p>Either way, if somebody can earn a penny or get filthy rich doing that, we are totally cool with that.</p>
